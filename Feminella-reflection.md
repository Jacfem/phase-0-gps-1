What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with the reasoning behind forking & cloning a repo, and also the reasoning behind git push versus git fetch/git merge.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concept of cloning was clarified. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked a lot of questions around the order of git commands, and best practices around the workflow for adding, committing, pushing and merging work.

What still confuses you about git?
I'm still confused about the process for larger teams, and how reviewing pull requests works on a larger project. I'm a bit confused at when we pull or fetch & merge our changes from the remote repo, into our local repo, where that is stored.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
This was a good experience, but honestly did not answer many of my questions!
